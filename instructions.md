# Gitea

## Documentation

- [Gitea documentation](https://gitea.com/gitea/docs) — upstream reference covering repositories, organizations, the admin panel, Gitea Actions, the API, and `app.ini` settings.

## What you get on StartOS

- A **Web UI and git (HTTP)** interface — the Gitea web app, and the endpoint for cloning, pushing, and pulling over HTTP.
- A **git (SSH)** interface (user `git`) for cloning, pushing, and pulling over SSH.
- An embedded SQLite database stored alongside repositories and LFS objects in a single managed volume — no separate database to install or configure.

## Getting set up

On first start Gitea posts a **Create Admin User** task. Until you complete it, the service has no administrator.

1. Run the **Create Admin User** task. Provide a username and email. A strong password is generated and shown once — copy it before dismissing the result. If you lose it later, run **Reset Admin Password**.
2. Sign in to the Web UI with those credentials.
3. If you plan to send emails (notifications, invitations, password resets), run **Configure SMTP** and pick either your StartOS system SMTP or custom credentials.

## Using Gitea

### Web UI and git over HTTP

Open the **Web UI and git (HTTP)** interface to reach the Gitea web app. The same hostnames serve git over HTTP, so you can clone, push, and pull using the URLs Gitea shows on each repository page.

### git over SSH

Open the **git (SSH)** interface to see the SSH host and port. Add your SSH public key under your Gitea user settings, then use the `git@…` URLs Gitea generates on each repository page.

### Actions

- **Set Primary Url** — pick which of the available HTTP URLs Gitea uses when generating clone URLs, links in emails, OAuth callbacks, and so on. Switch this whenever you add or change a domain you want users to see.
- **Enable / Disable Registrations** — toggle whether anyone with your Gitea URL can create an account. Registrations are disabled by default; enabling them is a public-signup decision, so the action confirms it with a warning.
- **Configure SMTP** — set the credentials Gitea uses to send mail. Choose your StartOS system SMTP or supply a custom host, port, from-address, username, and password.
- **Reset Admin Password** — pick an existing admin user and generate a new password for them. Use this to rotate the password or to recover an account whose password you've lost.

### Large file storage

Git LFS is enabled and stored alongside your repositories in the managed volume. Enable LFS per repository in its settings; use the Git LFS client on the pushing machine as you would with upstream Gitea.
